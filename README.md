## Prerequisites

- Linux operating system
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### System Requirements

The application reads data from various Linux system interfaces:

- `/sys/class/thermal/` - CPU temperatures
- `/sys/class/hwmon/` - Hardware monitoring (temps, fans, power)
- `/sys/devices/system/cpu/` - CPU frequencies
- `/sys/class/nvme/` - NVMe drive temperatures
- `/sys/class/power_supply/` - Battery information

For best results, ensure your kernel has the appropriate drivers loaded:
- `coretemp` or `k10temp` - CPU temperature
- `drivetemp` - SATA disk temperatures
- Hardware-specific drivers for fans and power sensors

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/system-monitor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   For development mode with DevTools:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Building for Distribution

To package the application for distribution:

1. **Install electron-builder**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev electron-builder
   ```

2. **Add build configuration to package.json**
   ```json
   "build": {
     "appId": "com.system-monitor.app",
     "linux": {
       "target": ["AppImage", "deb", "rpm"],
       "category": "System"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add build script**
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "electron-builder"
   }
   ```

4. **Build the package**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Permissions

The application reads system information from standard Linux interfaces. No special permissions are required for basic monitoring. However:

- Some sensors may require specific kernel modules to be loaded
- GPU monitoring works best with proprietary drivers (NVIDIA/AMD)
- Some power sensors may require root access (the app will skip unavailable sensors)

## Troubleshooting

### No temperature data

- Ensure temperature sensors are available: `ls /sys/class/thermal/`
- Install `lm-sensors`: `sudo apt install lm-sensors && sudo sensors-detect`
- Load appropriate kernel modules (`coretemp`, `k10temp`, etc.)

### No GPU data

- For NVIDIA: Install proprietary drivers and `nvidia-smi`
- For AMD: Ensure AMDGPU drivers are loaded
- The app uses the `systeminformation` library which may have limited GPU support on some configurations

### No fan data

- Check available fans: `ls /sys/class/hwmon/*/fan*_input`
- Some systems expose fan data through EC (embedded controller)
- Desktop motherboards usually have better fan sensor support

### No disk temperatures

- For NVMe: Built-in temperature sensors are usually available
- For SATA: Load the `drivetemp` kernel module: `sudo modprobe drivetemp`
- Some older drives don't have temperature sensors

### No power data

- Power sensors vary widely by hardware
- Laptops generally have better power monitoring
- Check: `ls /sys/class/hwmon/*/power*_input`

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Main Process** (`main.js`): Electron backend that handles system data collection
- **Preload Script** (`preload.js`): Secure IPC bridge between main and renderer
- **Renderer Process** (`renderer.js`): Frontend logic for data visualization
- **UI** (`index.html`, `styles.css`): Modern, responsive interface

### Data Sources

- **systeminformation library**: Cross-platform system information
- **Linux sysfs**: Direct access to kernel-exposed hardware data
- **Custom sensors**: Direct file system reads for enhanced data

### Update Frequency

- Default: 2 seconds
- Configurable in `renderer.js` (line 550)
- Balance between responsiveness and CPU usage

## Customization

### Change Update Interval

Edit `renderer.js`:
```javascript
// Update every X milliseconds (default: 2000 = 2 seconds)
setInterval(updateSystemData, 2000);
```

### Modify Color Scheme

Edit `styles.css` to change the gradient colors, backgrounds, or temperature thresholds.

### Add Custom Sensors

Edit `main.js` to add additional sensor reading logic in the system data collection functions.

**Note**: This application is designed specifically for Linux. Some features depend on available hardware sensors and kernel support. The app gracefully handles missing sensors by showing "No data available" messages.
